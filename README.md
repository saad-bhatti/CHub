## Motivation

We have always felt annoyed with the numerous different sites that different courses use. Examples include Crowdmark, Piazza, Quercus, Ed, and more. The goal of CHub is to create a centralized platform for all of student needs, such as marks and discussion boards. We hope that this project will reduce the amount of websites students need to jump around in their university career.
