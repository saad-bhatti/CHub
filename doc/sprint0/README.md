## Motivation
We have always felt annoyed with the numerous different sites that different courses use. Examples include Crowdmark, Piazza, Quercus, Ed, and more. The goal of CHub is to create a centralized platform for all of student needs, such as marks and discussion boards. We hope that this project will reduce the amount of websites students need to jump around in their university career.

## Contribution
- We will use git flow
  - Do not commit directly to `master` or `dev` branch
  - To create a new feature, branch off of `dev`
  - Once completed, create a pull request merging into `dev`
  - There must be 1 approval before merging
  - Once a release is ready, we will create a pull request merging `dev` into `master`
- We will simply name the branches the name of the feature
- We will use Jira for tickets. Every pull request will link to the Jira link
