For the user interface, we design the prototype using Balsamiq. Please download the UI.pdf to view the details. All the pages are listed on the left bar. Pages are designed differently for two main user types, student and professor. Clicking on the buttons or text boxes with a small arrow at the bottom-right to interact with the prototype, and explore the logical flow between pages, starting at the "Student - Log in" page to go through the student's key scenarios, and starting at the "Professor - Log in" page to see the professor's key account features.
