# Project Objective:
Direct the user to a list of courses they are enrolled/teaching upon login. Application will allow the user to view modules, assignments, grades, discussion boards, and announcements for a specific course. Moreover, the user can interact with or modify each of these sections depending on their role.  

# Key Personas:
**Key Persona 1**: Nick Cheng - a Computer Science professor who has worked at UofT since 1990. Nick might check the open discussions on CHub to reply to any quick questions that students have. As a professor, he will either grade some students’ assignments on CHub, or maybe communicate with some of his TAs on the instructors private discussion on CHub until his lunch break at noon.

**Key Persona 2**: Ben Fraser - a 25 year old Computer Science PhD student who TAs for undergraduate classes. He prepares for his tutorials by checking what the teacher has posted in the lecture material section on CHub. He will also frequently check the discussions section on CHub to answer any student questions along with grading student’s work whenever he has the time. 

**Key Persona 3**: Nicole Martinez - a 21 year old Biology student who is really bad with technology. She usually rarely uses her phone to study and therefore misses some important announcements or discussions on CHub. She also likes to write down most of her assignments and therefore has trouble submitting word or pdf documents. 

# Key Scenarios:
**Key Scenario 1**: Due to covid-19 and a shift to online learning, Nick needed a way to connect with his students. Students would need to have access to essential course material and view important announcements to stay informed with course administration. Moreover, Nick wants to provide his student a forum to discuss and exchange ideas related to the course.

**Key Scenario 2**: As a TA of several courses, Ben has to grade hundreds of assignments and examinations. To mitigate the risk of losing a paper, Ben refuses to commute with stacks of assessments. Instead, Ben wishes to provide feedback, grade each paper, and return them online through a portal.

**Key Scenario 3**: Since border restrictions have been relaxed, Nicole is looking for a flight back to Canada in order to attend in-person classes. However, due to flight availability, she will miss the first few weeks of classes. Given her situation, she needs to learn course material online to not fall behind.Therefore, she needs an online platform to access her course materials, view announcements, submit assignments, and discuss with her peers.

# Key Principles:
**Key Principle 1**: Quality over Quantity - The design should be such that features available to a user should be complete and bug-free rather than providing a higher number of features that are incomplete or infested with bugs. 

**Key Principle 2**: Feature-rich over Efficiency - The design should permit features for greater user functionality even at the cost of inefficiency in the backend systems. 

**Key Principle 3**: Adaptability - The design should be made such that features can be added or cut from the application without affecting existing features.
