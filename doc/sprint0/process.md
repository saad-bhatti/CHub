# Team process
## Team organization
The team is non-hierarchial, and everyone is expected to complete their tasks -- not at the last minute. Everyone is expected to divide the tasks amongst the front-end and back-end team members as well.

## Tools we used
All team communications are done in Discord. We mostly used Discord voice calls and chats. We also use Discord bots to help organize our team. We have a GitHub bot that will send a message for every pull request created in our repository, and we have another bot to remind us of our scrum meetings.

## How decisions are made and how we voted
During meetings, decisions are done using polls. We first spend some time brainstorming ideas if needed. After that, someone would send a message with a list of options, and we use the Discord emoji react feature to choose. We would use a maximum of 2 rounds of voting to reach a consensus. If we ever reach a tie in a poll, we will create a new poll with only the tied options.

If we ever need to collaborate or spend significant time brainstorming, we will create a Google Doc and share with it with the rest of the team.

## Frequency of meetings
We plan to meet 3 times a week. Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays in the evening. They are all done in Discord voice calls. We will host ad-hoc meetings if needed as well

## Moving forward
Moving forwards, we hope that everyone learns how important it is to be punctual, and contribute to meetings. We hope that we will continue this line of work moving towards next sprints.
