Possible competition to our project, CHub, include existing: 
1. online grading software
2. online educational Q&A platforms
3. university portals

Some products include Crowdmark (https://crowdmark.com), Piazza (https://piazza.com), and Quercus (https://q.utoronto.ca) respectively. 

Competitors of type (1) & (2) each compete with a portion of CHub but not with our product as a whole. Competitors of type (3) tend to possess undesirable problems that leave users unsatisfied and looking for external solutions. In particular, UofTâ€™s own portal Quercus does not have a seamless UI, resulting in many of its users switching to its competitors.

CHub will have a user base consisting of students, teachers, and teacher assistants. Many of our users will come from a background of using multiple distinct platforms for the same course/class which can result in missed work, miscommunication, and confusion between students and their instructors. Existing platforms have not solved this problem yet, because they specialized on a specific part of the problem in online learning (such as online grading or communication) but did not tackle the problem as a whole.

CHub will solve these problems for our users by bundling these various platforms into one portal along with our own features. This will allow users to track all course-related material within one platform with the luxury of a seamless UI for easy navigation. Therefore, by the reasons listed above, CHub will surpass its competition!
