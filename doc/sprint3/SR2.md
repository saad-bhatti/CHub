# Continued practices
- have someone write up standup meeting summaries
- discuss blockers
- asking for help in chat or in Discord DM's
- making helpful reviews on GitHub PRs
- task new tasks on your own
- look at documentation

# New practices
- swap backend and frontend teammates to bring new ideas to the team and adjust workloads 


# Harmful practies
- waiting until standup to ask for help on blockers
- push codes to remote without testing on local first

# Best experiences
- seeing the product go to life
- learning the tech stack
- TypeScript + Zod catching errors on compile time

# Worst experiences
