# Goals for this sprint
Complete the following user stories:
- **#2**: Grade assignments
  - Given that I am a teacher and there is at least one assignment/test submitted, when I click the “grade” button on any assignment/test, I should be able to add marks and comments for that assignment/test.
- **#5**: Reupload assignments
  - As a student(Nicolle), I want to be able to resubmit my assignment to overwrite the one I submitted earlier so that I can correct any mistakes or improve my work before the deadline.
- **#3**: Upload files (teachers)
  - Given that I am a teacher using the service and I’m logged in, when I click the “upload file” button and select a file to upload, then the file should be uploaded and can be accessed by my students.
- **#4**: Upload assignments
  - Given that I am a student using the service and I’m logged in, when I click the “upload file” button and select my assignment file, the assignment should be uploaded to the server where it can be accessed by my instructors.
